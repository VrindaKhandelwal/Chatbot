Quite often, one does not have the time to make small talk with every person or answer simples queries;
one would rather have an automated system perform such tasks. However, such systems could lack personality 
and therefore, give us the fact that it is not oneself on the other end. 
We have designed a personalised chatbot which can be trained on one's whatsapp conversations. 

We performed conversational modelling by implementing sequence to sequence networks which use Gated Recurrent Units.
We have not used attention in our model as the size of our sequences and chats are not too long.
